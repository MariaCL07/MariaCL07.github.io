           One of the newest poetry websites today. It doesn't matter what
           language you write in. Variety is important on this website.
           Safe, simple and suitable
           for everyone. Before poems can be published, they must be 
           to me first so I can make sure it is
           not disrespectful towards others.
           Share your emotions to the world and
           create a network of enterprising poets, like you. 
           Let's get started!

                    Me desnudo ante mi misma.
                    Dejo mi alma al descubierto;
                    no quiero seguir en el
                    camino que conlleva al abismo.

                    Aquella luz verde me salvó,
                    de esa oscuridad amarga.
                    Mas amarga que la
                    misma muerte sin precedentes.

        <p>
            My name is Paula, born in Guayaquil (Ecuador)
            but I grew up in Spain and have been living in Switzerland
            for seven years. Some of my work will be published
            in the course of time on this safe websites
            suitable for everyone.
            I hope that we can create something beautiful.

            "That vision, like all fearful visions of truth,arose
            from a chance union of diverse elements". 
            -Howards Phillips Lovecraft-

             Some of us are shy, reserved and even lonely. This can be
             a barrier to sharing what you have inside you. Others have not had the 
             opportunity to find what they are looking for. Some types of contacts 
             can be scary aswell. And in the search for a solution to that 
             "problem", I came up with the idea of creating a platform
             that really supports poets and writers who feel alone in the 
             wonderful world of writing. Why not connect with souls who share the same
             passion? The cyber world has infinite things to offer and contribute
             to the real world. Why not make use of this wonder. 
             For example, created a platform that brings trust and security,
             when it comes to opening your soul is crucial.
             A community that makes you grow and evolve is really beautiful!
             Writing is one of the most beautiful arts, so let's make
             something great out of it and out of us.
